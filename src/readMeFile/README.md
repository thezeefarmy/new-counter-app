## Overview

The Counter App is a simple web application that allows users to increment, decrement, and set a value for a counter. Users can also type a number into the display and click buttons to continuously increment or decrement by that number.

## Features

- Increment the counter by 1.
- Decrement the counter by 1.
- Set a specific value for the counter.
- Type a number into the display and increment or decrement by that number.
- Error handling for counts greater than 10.

## Usage

- Click the "+" button to increment the counter by 1.
- Click the "-" button to decrement the counter by 1.
- Type a number in the display input field and click the "+" or "-" buttons to continuously increment or decrement by that number.
- Click the "Set 10" button to set the counter to a specific value (i.e., 10).
- The counter value is displayed in a calculator-like display box.

## Error Handling

If the counter value exceeds 10, an error will be thrown, and an error message will be displayed.
